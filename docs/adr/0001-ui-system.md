# ADR 0001: UI System

## Decision
Use Nuxt UI v4 as the default UI component library.

## Context
We need fast iteration for landing pages and an admin dashboard, while keeping accessibility and theming manageable.

## Consequences
- Prefer Nuxt UI components over raw HTML.
- Avoid adding another UI library unless a capability is missing and justified with a new ADR.
